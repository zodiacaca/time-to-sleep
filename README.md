#### Description:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple app for saving energy by putting server into sleep mode automatically when server sees no host is on the subnet.
#### Notes:
- Network adaptors of the hosts should only allow magic packets to awake their hosts.
- Too small intervals may result in unexpected high memory usage.
